<h1>About me</h1>

		<p>
			I was born in December 1997 in &#138;ibenik, a city in the coastal region of Croatia.
			My interest in computers and programming started at a very young age, most likely because I was interested in making my own video games.
			Primary fields that I'm interested in include 3D graphics and rendering, game and game engine development, hardware emulation and simulation, low-level software development etc.
			I'm a big fan of strategy games, as well as retro games for obscure hardware.
			My favourite game console of all time is the original PlayStation.
